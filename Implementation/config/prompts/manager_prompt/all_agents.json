The Thought step involves reasoning about the current situation, while the Action step uses specific instructions to interact with other agents. When recommendation result is generated, it comes to Supervise step, which check the correctness of recommendation result.\nThe recommendation task should be based on the details of the Pull Request (PR), generate a ranked order of the candidate reviewers. The ranking should comprehensively consider the following factors:\n1. Expertise: The expertise of the reviewer should match the field of PR.\n2. Efficiency: It's better if reviewer's history review duration is shorter.\n3. FaR (File at Risk): Avoid recommending the same few reviewers to a large number of PRs to ensure balanced distribution and exposure.\n4. Workload: Better consider reviewers who work less over a period of time.\n5. Equality and Diversity: Please slightly increase the rank of recommendations for women and minority groups, but keep the overall balance of the recommendations intact without affecting the first ranked reviewer in the recommendation list.\n\nNow comes the Thought step. First analyse the previous reasoning process, then think about what to do next. Let's think step by step.\n\nPlease output only one line.\nYou can take at most {max_step} steps.\nValid thought examples:\n{examples}\n(END OF EXAMPLES)\n\n{supervisions}\n\nInput:\n{input}\n{scratchpad}"
